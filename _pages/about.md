Hello!

Ozzy is here...

I am an Applied Cryptography researcher who tries to apply cool Math formulas to real-life problems. My research interests are on the security and privacy of distributed/decentralized systems, which are mainly blockchain technology and collaborative learning and AI models. 

Currently, I am a postdoc researcher at Radboud University. I obtained my Ph.D. in the Cyber Security Group at the Delft University of Technology, M.Sc. degree in Electrical & Electronics Engineering and my B.Sc. degrees with a double major in Electrical & Electronics Engineering and Mathematics at Bogazici University.

Personally, I can define myself as a sporty person. I like to try and fail at new things. I play amateur-level chess but also enjoy watching Super GM tournaments. To keep my creative side alive, I also paint once in a while.
